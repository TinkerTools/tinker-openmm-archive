# Tinker-OpenMM: An OpenMM Version Enabling Tinker on GPUs

# NOTE: This OpenMM version for use as part of Tinker-OpenMM is now deprecated. The current Tinker release on the TinkerTools Github site supports the current OpenMM Github release from https://github.com/openmm. The modified OpenMM located here should only be used and will only work correctly with earlier releases of Tinker.

<H2><B>Introduction</B></H2>

[OpenMM](http://openmm.org) is a toolkit for molecular simulation. It can be used either as a stand-alone application for running simulations, or as a library you call from your own code. It provides a combination of extreme flexibility (through custom forces and integrators), openness, and high performance (especially on recent GPUs) that make it truly unique among simulation codes. This release differs from the Main OpenMM release as it contains a softcore VDW for lambda based free energy simulations. In addition, we have released an updated version of tinker dynamic_omm.x for runing simulations using tinker.To install this, See instructions at https://biomol.bme.utexas.edu/tinkergpu/index.php?title=Tinkergpu:Tinker-tut
